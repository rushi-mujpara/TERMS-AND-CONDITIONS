                <br>
                <p>Users acknowledge that the App utilizes content from
                    third-party APIs, including but not limited to Gemini. All

                    the respective third-party providers. The App does not claim
                    any ownership of third-party content and respects all
                    applicable copyright and trademark laws. The App merely
                    provides a formatted output of the content obtained from
                    these third-party APIs.

                <b>Intellectual Property Rights</b>
                <br>
                <p>All content provided through this App remains the property of
                    the original content providers. The App does not claim any
                    ownership of such content and strictly adheres to all
                    copyright and trademark laws. The App's role is solely to
                    format and present the content sourced from third-party APIs
                    without altering its original form or meaning.

                <b>Usage Permissions</b>
                <br>
                <p>Users agree to comply with the terms of use of the
                    third-party APIs from which content is sourced. Any
                    violation of these terms may result in the termination of
                    access to the App. Users are solely responsible for any
                    violations, including but not limited to the unauthorized
                    distribution of the content. Users must ensure that their
                    use of the content does not infringe on the intellectual
                    property rights of the third-party providers.

                <b>Disclaimer of Liability</b>
                <br>
                <p>The App provides content "as it is form" without any
                    representations or warranties regarding the accuracy,
                    reliability, or completeness of the third-party content. Any
                    errors, omissions, or misleading information in the content
                    are the responsibility of the third-party providers from
                    which the content is sourced. The App disclaims all
                    liability for such inaccuracies. As the content is directly
                    sourced from third-party APIs and presented in its original
                    format, the App functions solely as a conduit between the
                    API and the user and is not responsible for any violations
                    or problems caused by the user's actions. Users should be
                    aware that the content is generated through AI bots, which
                    may lead to occasional errors.
                </p>

                <b>User Conduct and Responsibility
                </b>
                <br>
                <p>Users must not collect and distribute the data for commercial
                    purposes unless explicitly permitted by the third-party
                    content providers. If a user chooses to engage in such
                    activities, they will be solely responsible for any
                    consequences that arise. Users who violate the terms of
                    third-party APIs for content sharing will be held
                    accountable for any resulting issues. The App reserves the
                    right to remove any content that violates these Terms or the
                    terms of the third-party content providers.

            <li>
                <b>Limitation of Liability</b>
                <br>
                <p>In no event shall the App be liable for any indirect,
                    incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of
                    or in connection with the use or inability to use the
                    third-party content. This limitation of liability applies to
                    all damages of any kind, including but not limited to loss
                    of data, revenue, or profits.

            <li>
                <b>Right to Modification</b>
                <br>
                <p>Txtlab reserves the right to modify these Terms and
                    Conditions at any time in response to changing legal,
                    operational, or regulatory requirements. Such modifications
                    will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Terms
                    on our App. By continuing to use the App after any changes
                    are posted, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. We
                    encourage you to review these Terms periodically to stay
                    informed about any updates.
